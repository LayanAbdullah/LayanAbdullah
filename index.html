            Luigi, two Italian plumbers who find themselves in the Mushroom Kingdom trying 
            to rescue Princess Toadstool from the evil King Bowser. It is one of the

        <h2>Mario Odyssey</h2>
        <p>Super Mario Odyssey is a 2017 platform game developed and published by 
            Nintendo for the Nintendo Switch. An entry in the Super Mario series, 
            it follows Mario and Cappy, a sentient hat that allows Mario to control 
            other characters and objects, as they journey across various kingdoms to 
            save Princess Peach from his nemesis Bowser, who plans to forcibly marry 
            her. In contrast to the linear gameplay of prior entries, the game 
            returns to the primarily open-ended, 3D platform gameplay featured in 
            Super Mario 64 and Super Mario Sunshine.
        </p>
        <img src="Images/Odyssey_1.jpeg" width="500"/>
        <p>The game was developed by Nintendo's Entertainment Planning & Development 
            division, and began development soon after the release of Super Mario 3D 
            World in 2013. Various ideas were suggested during development, and to 
            incorporate them all, the team decided to employ a sandbox-style of gameplay. 
            Unlike previous installments such as New Super Mario Bros. and Super Mario 
            3D World, which were aimed at a casual audience, the team designed Super 
            Mario Odyssey to appeal to the series' core fans. The game also features a 
            vocal theme song, "Jump Up, Super Star!", a first for the series.
        </p>
        <p>Super Mario Odyssey received acclaim from critics who called it one of 
            the best games in the series, with particular praise towards its 
            inventiveness and originality. It also won numerous awards, including 
            for game of the year. The game sold over 20 million copies by December 
            2020, making it one of the best-selling Switch games.
